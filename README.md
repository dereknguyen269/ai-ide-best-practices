## Introduction to AI-Powered IDEs

AI-powered IDEs represent the next evolution of code editors, offering intelligent assistance that dramatically improves development speed and code quality. This guide covers two leading options:

* **Cursor**: An AI-first editor built on VSCode with powerful code generation, editing, and chat features that understand your entire codebase.
* **GitHub Copilot**: Microsoft's AI pair programmer, seamlessly integrated into editors like VS Code, JetBrains, and Neovim to provide inline completions and chat-based assistance.

Understanding their distinct strengths will help you choose the right tool—or combination of tools—for your workflow.

## 1. Core Best Practices for Any AI Tool

Regardless of your chosen tool, these fundamental practices will maximize your results:

* **Be Specific with Instructions:** Vague prompts yield vague results. Instead of "Fix this," write "Refactor this function to use a `for...of` loop and handle potential null values."
* **Learn Effective Prompting:**
    * **Provide Context:** Give the AI background on your goal.
    * **Set Boundaries:** Clearly define what you want and, just as importantly, what you don't want.
    * **Iterate and Refine:** If the first result isn't perfect, adjust your prompt and try again. *Example: "Generate a React component for a user login form using TypeScript and Material UI. It should include fields for email and password, client-side validation, and call an `api.login` function on submit."*
* **Master Code Referencing:** Learn how to point the AI to relevant code.
    * **Cursor:** Uses `@` to reference files (`@file.js`) and symbols (`@functionName`).
    * **GitHub Copilot:** Automatically references your open files and can be directed in chat using `@workspace`.
* **Respect the Context Window:** All AIs have a limit to how much information they can process at once. For large-scale tasks:
    * **Break Down Problems:** Divide complex changes into smaller, manageable chunks.
    * **Focus the Context:** Use referencing features to show the AI only the most relevant code.
* **Provide Feedback:** These tools learn from your interactions. Use the built-in mechanisms to accept good suggestions and reject poor ones to improve future results.

## 2. Cursor-Specific Best Practices

* **Master Cursor's Commands:**
    * **Edit in Place (`Cmd+K`):** Cursor's most powerful feature. Select a block of code, press `Cmd+K`, and type your instructions to refactor it directly. Iterate with follow-up prompts.
    * **Chat with Your Code (`Cmd+L`):** Open the chat panel to ask questions about your entire codebase, generate new files, or debug complex issues. Use `@` references to focus the chat on specific files or symbols.
* **Generate New Code:** From an empty line, press `Cmd+L` to generate code based on the surrounding context. This is perfect for scaffolding new functions or components.
* **Configure Your Settings:**
    * **AI Model Selection:** Experiment with different models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus) to find the best balance of speed and intelligence for your needs.
    * **Customize Keybindings:** Tailor shortcuts to fit your existing muscle memory.

## 3. GitHub Copilot Best Practices

* **Leverage Inline Completions:** Copilot excels at suggesting code as you type. Start writing a line or a comment, and let Copilot finish it.
    * Use `Tab` to accept a suggestion.
    * Use `Alt+]` and `Alt+[` (or `Option+]` / `Option+[`) to cycle through alternative suggestions.
* **Turn Comments into Code:** Write a detailed comment describing the function you need, and Copilot will often generate the complete implementation for you. This is especially powerful for utility functions and test cases.
* **Use Copilot Chat Effectively:**
    * **Quick Actions:** Use `/` commands like `/explain`, `/fix`, and `/tests` for common tasks.
    * **Ask Questions:** Highlight a block of code and ask natural language questions like, "What does this regex do?" or "Is there a more performant way to write this?"

## 4. Leveraging Multi-Context Programming (MCP)

Pioneered by tools like **Cursor**, Multi-Context Programming (MCP) allows the AI to understand and operate across multiple files and data sources simultaneously.

* **Project-Wide Understanding:** Start a session by asking the AI to analyze your project structure. *Example: "Analyze my project and give me an overview of the architecture."*
* **Cross-File Operations:** Reference multiple files when making changes that span different parts of your application. *Example in Cursor: "In `@ComponentA.tsx` and `@ComponentB.tsx`, extract the shared logic into a new custom hook named `useSharedLogic.ts`."*
* **Context-Aware Generation:** When creating new code, ask the AI to adhere to existing patterns in your project. *Example: "Generate a new API service for managing products. Follow the same pattern and structure as `@UserService.ts`."*
* **MCP Server Extensions:** For advanced workflows, explore custom MCP servers that connect your IDE to external tools like Figma, databases, or APIs. See the [Awesome MCP Repositories](#awesome-mcp-repositories) list for examples.

## 5. Language-Specific Tips

* **Python:** Excellent for generating docstrings, adding type hints, refactoring loops into list comprehensions, and optimizing data transformations with pandas or NumPy.
* **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Invaluable for converting JS to TS, migrating class components to functional components with hooks, and scaffolding entire React/Vue/Svelte components.
* **Java:** A huge time-saver for generating boilerplate code like getters, setters, `equals()`, and `hashCode()`. Also great for implementing design patterns (e.g., Builder, Factory) and writing unit tests.
* **Go:** Strong at implementing interfaces, generating idiomatic error handling, and scaffolding table-driven tests.
* **Rust:** Extremely helpful for navigating ownership and borrowing rules, implementing traits, and suggesting memory-safe alternatives to `unsafe` blocks.

## 6. AI-Assisted Development Techniques

* **AI-Driven TDD:** Write a test case in a comment, let the AI generate the test code, and then prompt it to write the implementation that makes the test pass.
* **Learning New Technologies:** Ask the AI to scaffold a basic project with an unfamiliar framework. *Example: "Create a minimal 'Hello World' app using Go and the Fiber framework, and explain the role of each file."*
* **Pair Programming:** Use the AI as a sounding board. "Think aloud" in comments or chat to guide its suggestions. *Example: "// I'm thinking of using the strategy pattern here to handle different payment methods. Can you show me what that would look like?"*
* **Code Reviews:** Ask the AI to review your code before you commit. *Example: "Review this code for potential security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and deviations from standard best practices."*

## 7. Using AI for More Than Just Coding

Your AI assistant is a versatile tool for many development-adjacent tasks:

* **Documentation:** Generate READMEs, JSDoc comments, API documentation, and usage examples.
* **Git Operations:** Draft descriptive commit messages and pull request summaries based on your staged changes.
* **Debugging:** Paste an error message and the relevant code, then ask the AI to help you find the root cause and suggest a fix.
* **System Design:** Brainstorm architectural patterns, data models, and technology stacks for new projects.
