## 1. Embrace the AI: Chat, Edit, and Generate

The core of Cursor's power lies in its integrated AI. Don't treat it like a traditional editor; actively engage with the AI features:

*   **`/edit` (Inline Editing):** This is arguably the most powerful command.
    *   **Be Specific with Instructions:** Instead of saying "Fix this," say "Refactor this function to use a `for...of` loop and handle potential null values." The more context you provide, the better the result.
    *   **Select Code Precisely:** Highlight *exactly* the code you want to modify. Cursor's AI works on the selected region.
    *   **Iterate:** Don't be afraid to refine your instructions. If the first edit isn't perfect, provide further instructions: "/edit make the error message more user-friendly."
    *   **Use Cases:** Refactoring, bug fixing, adding comments, code optimization, style changes.
    *   **Example:** Select a function and type `/edit Convert this to an arrow function and add type annotations.`

> **Related:** [Inline Editing Details](https://docs.cursor.com/features/inline-editing)

*   **`@` (Symbol and File References):** This allows you to include context from your codebase.
    *   **`@` a file:** to give context of the whole file to your current edit instruction or chat prompt. Example: `How can I call /src/utils/helperFunctions.ts @src/utils/helperFunctions.ts in this code?`
    *   **`@` a symbol:** to provide context of a specific class, function, or variable. Example: `Can you explain what this function does? @myFunction`.
    *   **Combining `@`:** You can reference multiple files and symbols. Example: `/edit Refactor this function to use @helperFunction from @utils/helperFunctions.ts`

> **Related:** [Context Reference Guide](https://docs.cursor.com/features/context-reference)

## 2. Understand Cursor's Key Features

*   **AI Chat Interface:** 
    *   Use `CMD+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) to open the chat
    *   Generate code, explain complex logic, or get debugging assistance
    *   Provide clear, specific prompts for best results

*   **Generate Mode:**
    *   Use `CMD+L` (or `Ctrl+L`)
    *   Best for creating larger code blocks within the current file
    *   Relies heavily on surrounding context

*   **Multi-File Context:**
    *   Cursor understands project-wide context
    *   Can reference and work across multiple files
    *   Use `@` to provide specific file or symbol context

## 3. Configure Your Settings

Cursor offers several settings to customize your experience:

*   **AI Model:** Choose between different AI models (like GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo) based on your needs (speed vs. accuracy). Consider a faster model for simple tasks and a more powerful model for complex ones. You can also configure the use of a local LLM.
*   **Keybindings:** Customize keyboard shortcuts to match your preferences.
*   **Theme:** Choose a theme that's comfortable for your eyes.
*   **Extensions:** While Cursor is powerful on its own, you can still install extensions for additional functionality.

## 4. Understand Context Limits

Cursor's AI has a context window, meaning it can only "see" a limited amount of code at a time. For very large projects:

*   **Break Down Tasks:** Divide complex tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.
*   **Use `@` Effectively:** Use `@` references to provide relevant context from other parts of your codebase.
*   **Be Mindful of File Size:** For extremely large files, consider splitting them into smaller, more logical units.

## 5. Provide Feedback

Cursor's AI is constantly learning. Provide feedback on the generated code:

*   **Thumbs Up/Down:** Use the thumbs up/down buttons to rate the quality of the AI's suggestions. This helps improve the model over time.
*   **Regenerate:** If the suggestion isn't quite right, click the "Regenerate" button to try again.
*   **Report Issues:** If you encounter any bugs or unexpected behavior, report them to the Cursor team.

## 6. Leverage Live Coding with Cursor

Live coding in Cursor allows you to collaborate with the AI in real-time, creating a powerful pair-programming experience:

*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Use live coding to quickly iterate through implementation ideas.
    *   **Start Simple:** Begin with a basic skeleton and let Cursor help you flesh out the details.
    *   **Guide the AI:** Use comments to direct Cursor's focus during live coding sessions.
    *   **Example:** Write `// TODO: implement authentication logic` and let Cursor suggest implementations.

*   **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** When facing a complex problem:
    *   **Talk Through Logic:** Verbalize your thought process using comments, then use `/edit` to get Cursor's input.
    *   **Step-by-Step Refinement:** Build solutions incrementally, with AI assistance at each stage.
    *   **Example:** Add a comment `// Need to optimize this sorting algorithm for large datasets` and use `/edit` for suggestions.

*   **Learning New Technologies:** Use live coding to explore unfamiliar frameworks or languages.
    *   **Scaffold & Expand:** Let Cursor generate a basic implementation, then work with it to understand and customize the code.
    *   **Example:** Type `// Create a basic GraphQL resolver for user authentication` and build upon Cursor's generated code.


## 7. Optimize Multi-Context Programming (MCP) Services

Cursor's MCP services allow the AI to understand and work with multiple contexts across your project:

*   **Project-Wide Understanding:**
    *   **Initialize with Architecture:** Start by asking Cursor to analyze your project structure for better contextual understanding.
    *   **Example:** Use chat to ask `Can you analyze my project structure and give me an overview of the architecture?`
    *   **Benefits:** Cursor will better understand relationships between components when providing suggestions.

*   **Cross-File Operations:**
    *   **Refactoring Across Boundaries:** Use MCP for changes that span multiple files.
    *   **Example:** `@Component1.js @Component2.js I need to extract the common logic from these components into a shared hook.`
    *   **Multi-Step Process:** For complex operations, break them down into logical steps that Cursor can tackle sequentially.

*   **Context-Aware Code Generation:**
    *   **Build Compatible Components:** When generating new code, reference existing patterns and structures.
    *   **Example:** `Generate a new API service that follows the same pattern as @apiService.js but for user authentication.`
    *   **Consistency Enforcement:** Use MCP to ensure new code maintains project conventions.

*   **Smart Dependency Management:**
    *   **Holistic Understanding:** Cursor can track dependencies across files to suggest better implementations.
    *   **Example:** `How would changing this interface @types/User.ts affect my application?`
    *   **Impact Analysis:** Before making significant changes, ask Cursor to analyze potential impacts.

## 8. Language-Specific Tips

While the core principles apply across languages, there are often language-specific nuances:

*   **Python:**
    *   `/edit` is excellent for refactoring list comprehensions, generator expressions, and asynchronous code.
    *   Use the chat to generate docstrings conforming to specific styles (e.g., Google, NumPy).
    *   **Example:** `/edit Refactor this to use a list comprehension and add type hints.`


*   **JavaScript/TypeScript:**
    *   `/edit` excels at converting between JavaScript and TypeScript, adding types, and working with modern syntax (e.g., async/await, arrow functions).
    *   Use the chat for generating React components, Redux reducers, or utility functions.
    *   **Example:** `/edit Convert this class component to a functional component with hooks.`

*   **Java:**
    *  Cursor can help streamline verbose Java code, such as generating getters and setters, implementing interfaces, or creating unit tests.
    *  Use chat to get suggestions on design patterns and best practices.
    *   **Example:** `/edit Generate equals and hashCode methods for this class.`

*   **C++:**
     *  Cursor can help with complex memory management tasks and template metaprogramming.
     *  Leverage the chat to debug segfaults, understand compiler errors.
     *   **Example:** `/edit Add a smart pointer to prevent memory leaks`.


## 9. Use Cursor for More Than Just Coding

Cursor isn't just for writing code; it can also help with other development tasks:

*   **Documentation:** Generate comments, README files, and API documentation.
*   **Code Reviews:** Use the chat to explain your code to reviewers or ask for feedback.
*   **Learning:** Explore new languages, frameworks, or libraries by asking Cursor to generate examples and explain concepts.
*   **Git Messages:** Use Cursor to create well-written, informative commit messages. `/edit` on the staged changes.
*   **Debugging**: Use Cursor to identify the issue and fix your code.
