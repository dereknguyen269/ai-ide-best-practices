## 1. Embrace the AI: Chat, Edit, and Generate

The core of Cursor's power lies in its integrated AI. Don't treat it like a traditional editor; actively engage with the AI features:

*   **`/edit` (Inline Editing):** This is arguably the most powerful command.
    *   **Be Specific with Instructions:** Instead of saying "Fix this," say "Refactor this function to use a `for...of` loop and handle potential null values." The more context you provide, the better the result.
    *   **Select Code Precisely:** Highlight *exactly* the code you want to modify. Cursor's AI works on the selected region.
    *   **Iterate:** Don't be afraid to refine your instructions. If the first edit isn't perfect, provide further instructions: "/edit make the error message more user-friendly."
    *   **Use Cases:** Refactoring, bug fixing, adding comments, code optimization, style changes.
    *   **Example:** Select a function and type `/edit Convert this to an arrow function and add type annotations.`

*   **`@` (Symbol and File References):** This allows you to include context from your codebase.
    *   **`@` a file:** to give context of the whole file to your current edit instruction or chat prompt. Example: `How can I call /src/utils/helperFunctions.ts @src/utils/helperFunctions.ts in this code?`
    *   **`@` a symbol:** to provide context of a specific class, function, or variable. Example: `Can you explain what this function does? @myFunction`.
    *   **Combining `@`:** You can reference multiple files and symbols. Example: `/edit Refactor this function to use @helperFunction from @utils/helperFunctions.ts`

> **Related:** [Leveraging Context in Cursor for Better Code Understanding](https://cursor.sh/blog/context-driven-development) - Discover how to effectively use the `@` symbol to improve AI comprehension.

*   **Chat (CMD+K / Ctrl+K):** Use the chat interface for:
    *   **Generating Code from Scratch:** Describe what you want to build (e.g., "Create a React component that displays a list of users with their names and email addresses").
    *   **Explaining Code:** Ask Cursor to explain code you don't understand (e.g., "What does this regular expression do?"). You can paste code directly into the chat.
    *   **Debugging:** Describe the error you're encountering and any relevant code. Cursor can often suggest potential causes and solutions.
    *   **Planning and Design:** Discuss architectural decisions or ask for recommendations on libraries or frameworks.
    *   **Example:** Type `CMD+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) and then "Generate a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the average."

> **Related:** [From Idea to Implementation: Effective Chatting with Cursor](https://cursor.sh/blog/chat-strategies) - Learn conversation techniques that yield better code generation results.

*   **Generate (CMD+L / Ctrl+L):** The dedicated "Generate" mode is best for creating larger blocks of code *within* the current file.
    *   **Context is Key:** Cursor uses the surrounding code as context. Make sure your cursor is in the right place (e.g., inside a class, within a function) for the generated code to be relevant.
    *   **Provide a Clear Prompt:** Be as descriptive as possible about the code you want to generate.
    *   **Example:** Place your cursor inside a class and type `CMD+L` (or `Ctrl+L`) and then "Create a method that fetches data from an API endpoint and updates the state."

## 2. Master the Keyboard Shortcuts

Like any powerful tool, Cursor is most efficient when used with keyboard shortcuts. Learn the essentials:

*   **CMD+K / Ctrl+K:** Open the chat interface.
*   **CMD+L / Ctrl+L:** Open the Generate mode.
*   **CMD+Shift+L / Ctrl+Shift+L:** Apply the suggested edit (when using `/edit`).
*   **CMD+Z / Ctrl+Z:** Undo (works for AI edits too!).
*   **CMD+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z:** Redo.
*   **Learn your IDE's standard shortcuts:** Cursor builds upon standard IDE shortcuts (e.g., for navigation, selection, and editing).

## 4. Understand Context Limits

Cursor's AI has a context window, meaning it can only "see" a limited amount of code at a time. For very large projects:

*   **Break Down Tasks:** Divide complex tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.
*   **Use `@` Effectively:** Use `@` references to provide relevant context from other parts of your codebase.
*   **Be Mindful of File Size:** For extremely large files, consider splitting them into smaller, more logical units.

## 7. Optimize Multi-Context Programming (MCP) Services

Cursor's MCP services allow the AI to understand and work with multiple contexts across your project:

*   **Project-Wide Understanding:**
    *   **Initialize with Architecture:** Start by asking Cursor to analyze your project structure for better contextual understanding.
    *   **Example:** Use chat to ask `Can you analyze my project structure and give me an overview of the architecture?`
    *   **Benefits:** Cursor will better understand relationships between components when providing suggestions.

*   **Cross-File Operations:**
    *   **Refactoring Across Boundaries:** Use MCP for changes that span multiple files.
    *   **Example:** `@Component1.js @Component2.js I need to extract the common logic from these components into a shared hook.`
    *   **Multi-Step Process:** For complex operations, break them down into logical steps that Cursor can tackle sequentially.

*   **Context-Aware Code Generation:**
    *   **Build Compatible Components:** When generating new code, reference existing patterns and structures.
    *   **Example:** `Generate a new API service that follows the same pattern as @apiService.js but for user authentication.`
    *   **Consistency Enforcement:** Use MCP to ensure new code maintains project conventions.

*   **Smart Dependency Management:**
    *   **Holistic Understanding:** Cursor can track dependencies across files to suggest better implementations.
