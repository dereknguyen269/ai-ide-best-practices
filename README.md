**✅ Be Specific and Clear:**
```
"Refactor this function to use async/await instead of promises and add proper error handling"
"Convert this class component to a functional component using React hooks"
```

### 2. 🎪 Context Management

**Provide Rich Context:**
- Explain your goal and constraints
- Reference related files and functions
- Specify coding standards and patterns
- Include relevant business logic

**Example Context Block:**
```typescript
// filepath: /src/components/UserProfile.tsx
/*
Goal: Create a user profile component
Requirements:
- TypeScript with strict typing
- Material-UI components
- Handle loading and error states
- Follow existing component patterns in @components/BaseComponent.tsx
*/
```

### 3. 🔄 Iterative Refinement

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic functionality
2. **Review Output**: Check generated code carefully
3. **Refine Prompts**: Adjust based on results
4. **Build Incrementally**: Add features step by step

## 🔗 Multi-Context Programming (MCP)

**What is Multi-Context Programming?**
Multi-Context Programming (MCP) is a paradigm where AI assistants can understand and operate across multiple files, data sources, and contexts simultaneously. Think of it as giving your AI assistant a "bird's eye view" of your entire project rather than just the single file you're working on.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Project-Wide Understanding**: AI can see relationships between different parts of your codebase
- **Cross-File Refactoring**: Make changes that span multiple files intelligently
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: AI considers your project's existing patterns and conventions
- **External Data Integration**: Connect to databases, APIs, and other external systems

### 🌐 Cross-File Operations

**Project-Wide Refactoring:**
```
"Extract the authentication logic from @LoginForm.tsx and @SignupForm.tsx into a shared @hooks/useAuth.ts hook"
```

**Architecture Analysis:**
```
"Review @api/, @components/, and @utils/ directories and suggest a more scalable folder structure"
```

### 🔌 MCP Server Integration

MCP servers are specialized connectors that extend your AI assistant's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services.

**Popular MCP Servers:**
- **Figma MCP**: Connect designs to code, extract component specifications
- **Database MCP**: Query and manage databases directly from your editor
- **API MCP**: Interact with REST APIs, generate client code
- **Git MCP**: Enhanced version control operations and repository analysis
- **Slack/Teams MCP**: Integrate with team communication tools
