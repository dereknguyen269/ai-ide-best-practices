## 1. Core Best Practices Across AI IDEs

Regardless of which AI IDE you use, these fundamental practices will help you get the most value:

*   **Be Specific with Instructions:** The more detailed and clear your instructions, the better the results. Instead of "Fix this," say "Refactor this function to use a `for...of` loop and handle potential null values."

*   **Learn Effective Prompting:**
    * **Context Matters:** Provide background information about what you're trying to accomplish
    * **Boundary Setting:** Clearly define what you want and don't want
    * **Iterative Refinement:** If the first result isn't perfect, refine your prompt and try again
    * **Example:** "Generate a React component that handles form submission with validation. It should use React hooks and TypeScript, following Material UI styling conventions."

*   **Master Reference Techniques:** Each AI IDE offers ways to reference existing code:
    * **Cursor:** Uses `@` for files and symbols
    * **GitHub Copilot:** References visible editor context
    * **Windsurf:** Uses natural language references
    * **Trae:** Uses automatic context detection with manual override options

*   **Understanding Context Limits:** All AI code assistants have context windows. For very large projects:
    * **Break Down Tasks:** Divide complex tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks
    * **Provide Essential Context:** Learn how to reference only the most relevant parts
    * **Be Mindful of File Size:** For extremely large files, consider splitting them into smaller, more logical units

*   **Provide Feedback:** All these tools improve with feedback:
    * **Acceptance/Rejection:** Use the provided mechanisms to accept good suggestions and reject poor ones
    * **Iterative Refinement:** If a suggestion isn't quite right, refine your prompt and try again
    * **Report Issues:** If you encounter bugs or unexpected behavior, report them to the respective teams
